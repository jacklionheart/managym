## Config
Games: 500, Seed: 42, Threads: 1
Deck: Grey Ogre mirror, Policy: random

## Throughput
- 115.67 games/sec
- 17,039 steps/sec
- 147.3 steps/game avg

## Delta vs Previous (20260116-1631)

| Metric | Previous | Current | Change |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Throughput | 339.65 games/sec | 115.67 games/sec | **-66.0%** |
| Steps/sec | 16,607 | 17,039 | **+2.6%** |
| Games | 200 | 500 | +150% |
| Total steps | 9,779 | 73,652 | +653% |
| Avg steps/game | 48.9 | 147.3 | +201% |

**Note:** The apparent throughput drop is due to longer games. Steps/sec is comparable, and avg steps/game increased from 49 to 147 because the Grey Ogre mirror (random policy) now runs to actual game conclusions rather than an early cutoff.

## Amplification Ratios
- Agent steps: 73,652
- Game ticks: 473,780 (6.4x agent steps)
- Turn/phase/step ticks: 699,093 (9.5x agent steps)
- Priority ticks: 615,234 (8.4x agent steps)
- Inner priority (actual decisions): 12,839 (0.17x agent steps = 97.9% trivial)

## Key Observations

1. **Tick amplification remains high**: 9.5x internal ticks for every agent step.

2. **Turn hierarchy overhead**: 26% of env_step time (1.014s) spent in turn/phase/step traversal.

3. **Priority system**: 7.2% of time (0.282s), but 97.9% of priority ticks are trivial (only PassPriority).

4. **Observation remains efficient**: 4.0% of time (0.155s) — lazy creation working well.

5. **Action execution now tracked**: 3.8% of time (0.148s for 473k executions = 0.3μs each).

6. **Large unaccounted gap**: 54.6% of env_step time is outside tracked scopes — likely the skip_trivial loop overhead and inter-scope transitions.
