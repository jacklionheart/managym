## Comparison with Previous Profile

Comparing with profile-20260116-1606.md (Grey Ogre vs Grey Ogre deck):

| Metric | Previous | Current | Change |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Games/sec | 135 | 295.55 | +119% |
| Steps/sec | 12,717 | 14,682 | +15% |
| Avg steps/game | 94.2 | 49.7 | -47% |
| observation % | 18.4% | 18.3% | ~same |
| turn % | 21.7% | 23.8% | +2% |

The significant throughput improvement is primarily due to different deck configuration (Grey Ogre vs Llanowar Elves) resulting in shorter games. The per-step overhead ratios remain similar, confirming the baseline measurements are consistent.

## Notes

Key observations (raw data, no analysis):
- ~6.8 ticks per step on average (169,118 ticks / 24,840 steps)
- Observation building accounts for 18.3% of total step time
- Turn processing accounts for 23.8% of total step time
- 40.5% of step time is overhead outside game/tick (1.5844 - 0.9427 = 0.6417s)
- Each step calls observation() multiple times (169,118 obs calls for 24,840 steps = 6.8x)
- populatePermanents is the most expensive observation sub-component (5.5%)
